# Machine Learning Trading Bot

# Overview
In this project, I aimed to improve the algorithmic trading systems used by a financial advisory firm by enhancing the existing trading signals with machine learning algorithms that can adapt to new data. I followed the following steps:
* Imported and preprocessed a dataset of historical stock prices and technical indicators such as moving averages and trading volumes.
* Trained and evaluated multiple machine learning models, including linear regression, random forest, and neural networks, to predict future stock prices.
* Used the best performing model to make trading decisions automatically, based on its predictions.
* Evaluated the performance of our trading bot using various metrics such as return on investment and accuracy.
My approach showed promising results, with my trading bot outperforming the baseline trading algorithm by a significant margin. I believe that my use of machine learning algorithms to enhance trading signals can provide a valuable tool for financial advisors in today's highly dynamic and competitive market.
